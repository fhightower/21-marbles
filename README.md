# 21 Marbles

The code in this repo. is inspired by a game which involves 21 marbles.  The rules of the game are simple:

- Players take turns removing 1, 2, or 3 marbles from the central set of marbles.
- A player must remove a marble when it is his/her turn and cannot add marbles to the central set.
- The player who takes the last marble losses (or this can be reversed so that the player who takes the last marble wins).

I like to use this game to teach some principles that are central to game theory.  It is a very simple game that has some fun 
and often surprising results once one starts to analyze it.
