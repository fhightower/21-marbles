# 21 Marbles

The code in this repo. is inspired by a game which involves 21 marbles.  The rules of the game are simple:

- There are 21 marbles (or other objects) in a central set.
- 2 players take turns removing 1, 2, or 3 marbles from the central set.
- A player **must** remove 1, 2, or 3 marbles when it is his/her turn.
- The player who takes the last marble loses (or it can be played such that the player who takes the last marble wins).

I like to use this game to teach some basic principles of game theory.  It is a very simple game that has some fun and often surprising results when one starts to investigate it.
